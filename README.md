## 📁 Project Structure

- **GL/** – Usage of the Graphics Library for 3D rendering and game development.
- **clipping/** – Implementation of the **Liang-Barsky clipping algorithm** for 2D graphics.
- **labExam/** – Various lab exercises related to OpenGL programming.
- **pygame/** – Graphics projects implemented using **Pygame**, a popular Python game development library.
- **vectors/** – Working with vectors in OpenGL for transformations and rendering.
